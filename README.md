### [1] SDLC 

SDLC or the abbreviated term System Development Life Cycle is a term generallly applied to system engineering, information systems and software engineering to describe the  process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system.

### [2] SDLC Methodologies

There are numerous SDLC Methodologies or ways in which to portray the proccess of the plan, creation and deployment of an information system. The methods usually consist of various benefits though also wrought disadvantages if used incorrectly or in the wrong situation since each model is designed and deseganated for a different situation as it is likely that the creator created the system in order to fix their own issues which could not be fixed by following the current models of their time (essentially building upon models to improve the efficency or creating a new model to cater to their situation). 

A few of the models are realiterated below in detail, going through the models purpose or brief definition, the advantages, disadvantages of each model and one or two examples as to where the methodology or model would be applied;

### Waterfall method-

The waterfall is a sequentian non-iterative design model , used in software development proccesses. Furthermore as suggested in the conceptual name and illustrated in the  overall outlook of the theoretical waterfall model it can be likened to that of a literal waterfall, following a similiar system; flowing steadily downwards (hence the name waterfall) through phases of conception, initiation, analysis, design, construction, testing, production/implementation and maintenance.

#### Disadvatages 

The disadvantages of the waterfall model essentailly stem from the inability to track back once the testing stage had been reached which is detremental particuarlly in a long term massive project with numerous epics,as for instance if a group of developers are asked to create a system for a govering body (goverment or group) but the leaders of the governing body change with those who may have different ideologys in comparision to the previous leaders it is likely that the developers will be asked to alter a huge portion of the program and since with the water fall model it is essentially impossible to track back it is likely that the group of developers will have to start again making all there previous work futile (useless/worthless).

Therefore the waterfall methodology can only really work or be applied in instances where the project that is being handled is small and there are no uncertain requirements.

Another disadvantage is that no working software is produced until late during the life cycle, meaning that the developers will have to use conceptual designs and hope that once the theory is put into practice the software works, whilst the conceptual ideas will have to be solid to back up their ideas when talking with investors or whoever the program is being designed and created for.

The following point links in with the disadvantage noted above and that is that there is a high risk and uncertainty, meaning that though something may seem or sound pluasable during design and planning stage it may not actually function correctly when initiated in the production phase.

#### Advantages

The advantages of the waterfall model consist of the simple methodology and structure behind the model, making it easy to understand and use as like a waterfall the proccessess only flow one way not branching back or off the rythm or flow. 

Furthermore in this model phases are processed and completed one at a time, therefore phases do not overlap.
Whilst it is also easy to manage due to the rigidity of the model, each phase has specific deliverables and a review process.

#### Example 

For the type of software products that do not change very much once they are specified (for instance; a personilized data base) , the waterfall model is still viable. However, for software products that have their feature sets redefined during development because of user feedback and other factors, the traditional waterfall model is no longer appropriate.

### Evolutionary Model

The Evolutionary Model or approach is based on the idea of rapidly developing an initial software implementation from very abstract specifications and modifying this according to an appraisal (phases are concurrent and feedback is given and used between each phase). 

#### Advantages 

This is the only method appropriate for situations where a detailed system specification is unavailable. Effective in rapidly producing small systems, software with short life spans, and developing sub-components of larger systems.

#### Disadvantages

It is difficult to measure progress and produce documentation reflecting every version of the system as it evolves. This paradigm usually results in badly structured programs due to continual code modification. Production of good quality software using this method requires highly skilled and motivated programmers.
#### Example

### Prototyping  Model

The Prototyping Model is a systems development method (SDM) in which a prototype (an early approximation of a final system) displays the functionality of the product under development, but may not actually hold the exact logic of the original software (early copy of the system, used to understand the requirements). That is to say that it is built, tested, and then reworked as necessary until an acceptable prototype is finally achieved from which the complete system or product can now be developed (the prototype is essentially the frame work).

#### Advantages

The advantages that stem from the use of Prototyping consist of users being actively involved in the development, furthermore since in this methodology a working model of the system is provided, the users also get a better understanding of the system being developed.

Moreover errors, missing functionality and confusing functions can be detected and identified much earlier and more easily ,whilst quicker user feedback is available leading to better solutions.

#### Disadvantages

The disadvantges of the Prototype model is that it leads to implementing and then repairing way of building systems.
While practically, this methodology may increase the complexity of the system as scope of the system may expand beyond the original plans.
Moreover the application being  may cause the application not to be used as the full system was initially designed or intended.

#### Example 

The Prototype model should typically be applied when the desired system needs to have a lot of interaction with the end users.
This links commonly to , online systems and web interfaces that have a very high amount of interaction with end users, being best suited for Prototype model. though it may take time for a system to be built that allows ease of use and needs minimal training for the end user.

### Spiral Method

This Spiral model is a combination of iterative development process model and sequential linear development model i.e. the waterfall model with a very high emphasis on risk analysis. The spiral model has four phases: Planning, Risk Analysis, Engineering and Evaluation. Each subsequent spirals builds on the baseline spiral.

#### Advantages

The advantages for implementing the spiral model into practice consist of a high amount of risk analysis hence, avoidance of Risk is enhanced. Inaddition the model is particuarly  suitable for larger projects with storng approval and documentation control. Whilst the software is produced at an early stage in the software life cycle and additional functionality can be added at a later date.

#### Disadvantages

Though the model heralds numerous advantages it also has its own problems or disadvantages, theses being that it can be a costly model to use. Furthermore the risk analysis requires highly specific expertise and the projectâ€™s success is highly dependent on the risk analysis phase. This model is also not suited for smaller projects.

#### Examples

The spiral model in SDLC is very popular in software engineering, website and software development. Furthermore the Spiral Model should only be implemented When evaulating the costs and risk, and for medium to high risk projects, or where the requirements are complex or the users are unsure of their needs.Moreover the project should be a long term  commitment unwise because of potential changes to economic priorities (significant changes expected).

### Rapid Application Development (RAD)

Rapid application development is a software development methodology that uses minimal planning in favor of rapid prototyping.A prototype being a working model that is functionally equivalent to a component of the product, so essentially rapid application development follows a similiar a model, ideology to the prototyping modell, coming to a consensus.

#### Adavantages

The advantages of Rapid Application Development are as follows; Changing requirements can be accommodated, Progress can be measured, Iteration time can be short with use of powerful RAD tools,Productivity with fewer people in a short time, Reduced development time, increases reusability of components and encourages customer feedback.

#### Disadvantages

The Disadvantages of Rapid Application Development are that there is dependency on technically strong team members for identifying business requirements.Whilst only systems that can be modularized can be built using RAD, which also requires highly skilled developers/designers.
Inaddition the model is inapplicable to cheaper projects as cost of modeling and automated code generation is very high.

#### Examples

RAD model can be applied successfully to the projects in which clear modularization is possible. If the project cannot be broken into modules, RAD may fail.

### [3] Spiral-lifecycle-model-Risk-Management

The Spiral life cycle is a risk-driven model which means that the overall success of a project highly depends on the risks analysis phase. Futher linking into how risks are managed in the model, analysis is critical,(manged through)identifying, estimating and monitoring the technical feasibility and management risks, such as schedule slippage and cost overrun. Moreover once the build is tested, at the end of first iteration, feedback on the software (evaluation) is retrieved or given, which can further help manage and avoid problems (implications/complications) or risks.
